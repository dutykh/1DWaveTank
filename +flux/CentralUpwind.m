% +flux/CentralUpwind.m
%
% Purpose:
%   Computes the Central-Upwind numerical flux for the 1D Non-Linear Shallow
%   Water Equations (NSW). This flux is based on the Kurganov-Tadmor/Kurganov-
%   Noelle-Petrova semi-discrete scheme that combines advantages of central
%   and upwind approaches, resulting in less numerical diffusion than first-order
%   methods while maintaining good stability properties.
%
% Syntax:
%   F = CentralUpwind(wL, wR, cfg)
%
% Inputs:
%   wL  - [1 x 2, double] State vector [H, HU] on the left side of the interface.
%   wR  - [1 x 2, double] State vector [H, HU] on the right side of the interface.
%   cfg - [struct] Configuration structure. Required fields: cfg.phys.g, cfg.phys.dry_tolerance.
%
% Outputs:
%   F   - [1 x 2, double] Central-Upwind numerical flux vector [F_H, F_HU] across the interface.
%
% Dependencies:
%   None (standalone flux function, but expects correct cfg.phys.g and cfg.phys.dry_tolerance).

    % Central-Upwind Flux Formulation                            %
    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    % The central-upwind flux is based on the Kurganov-Noelle-Petrova (KNP) scheme.
    % F = (a_plus * FL - a_minus * FR) / (a_plus - a_minus) + 
    %     (a_plus * a_minus) / (a_plus - a_minus) * (wR - wL)
    
    % Calculate the denominator (avoid division by zero handled earlier)
    delta_a = a_plus - a_minus; % Nx1
    
    % Calculate the flux terms using element-wise operations for broadcasting
    term1 = (a_plus ./ delta_a) .* FL;   % (Nx1 ./ Nx1) .* Nx2 => Nx2
    term2 = (a_minus ./ delta_a) .* FR;  % (Nx1 ./ Nx1) .* Nx2 => Nx2
    term3 = ((a_plus .* a_minus) ./ delta_a) .* (wR - wL); % ((Nx1.*Nx1)./Nx1) .* Nx2 => Nx2
    
    % Combine terms for the KNP flux
    F = term1 - term2 + term3; % Nx2
    
    % Handle the purely upwind cases (where the formula might be less stable or simplifies)
    % When a_minus >= 0, all waves move rightward, use left flux
    idx_right = a_minus >= 0;
    F(idx_right, :) = FL(idx_right, :);
    
    % When a_plus <= 0, all waves move leftward
    idx_left = a_plus <= 0;
    F(idx_left, :) = FR(idx_left, :);
    
    % Handle any NaN values that might have occurred despite safeguards
