% +cfg/default_config.m
%
% Purpose:
%   Provides a default set of configuration parameters for the 1DWaveTank code.
%   This function returns a structure containing baseline values for all
%   simulation parameters (physical, mesh, numerics, BCs, ICs, visualization).
%   These defaults can be overridden by scenario-specific or user settings.
%
% Syntax:
%   config = default_config()
%
% Inputs:
%   (none)
%
% Outputs:
%   config - [struct] Complete configuration structure with default values for
%            all major simulation settings and function handles.
%
% Dependencies:
%   None directly, but function handles (e.g., for fluxes, BCs, ICs) must
%   correspond to available files in the codebase.
%
% References:
%   - See 1DWaveTank UserGuide.md for structure and usage.
