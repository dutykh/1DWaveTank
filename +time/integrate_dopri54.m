% +time/integrate_dopri54.m
%
% Purpose:
%   Solves a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the
%   Dormand-Prince 5(4) method (DOPRI54), an adaptive embedded Runge-Kutta
%   method. This method provides 5th-order accuracy with an embedded 4th-order
%   solution for error estimation. The Dormand-Prince method is optimized for
%   efficiency and is the basis for MATLAB's ode45 solver.
%
% Syntax:
%   [sol_out, t_out, stats] = integrate_dopri54(rhs_handle, tspan, w0, cfg)
%
% Inputs:
%   rhs_handle - [function handle] Function handle for the RHS of the ODE system.
%                Expected signature: dwdt = rhs_handle(t, w, cfg)
%   tspan      - [vector] Time points at which the solution should be output.
%                The integration proceeds from tspan(1) to tspan(end).
%   w0         - [column vector] Initial state vector at time tspan(1).
%   cfg        - [struct] Configuration structure containing parameters passed
%                to the rhs_handle and controlling the integrator.
%                Required fields in cfg.time:
%                  adaptive_tol:   Desired tolerance for error control.
%                Optional fields in cfg.time:
%                  dt_init:        Initial time step guess [s].
%                  safety_factor:  Safety factor for step size adjustment (default: 0.9).
%                  min_factor:     Minimum step size reduction factor (default: 0.2).
%                  max_factor:     Maximum step size increase factor (default: 5.0).
%                  max_steps:      Maximum allowed integration steps (default: 1e6).
%                  num_progress_reports: Number of progress updates to print (default: 10).
%
% Outputs:
%   sol_out    - [M x N matrix] Solution matrix, where M is the number of output
%                time points and N is the size of the state vector. Each row
%                sol_out(i,:) is the state vector at time t_out(i).
%   t_out      - [M x 1 vector] Column vector of time points corresponding to
%                the rows in sol_out.
%   stats      - [struct] Structure containing integration statistics:
%                stats.nsteps:   Total number of successful time steps taken.
%                stats.nfailed:  Total number of rejected steps (failed attempts).
%                stats.nfevals:  Total number of function evaluations.
%
% Dependencies:
%   - The RHS function specified by rhs_handle.
%   - Configuration settings within the cfg structure.
